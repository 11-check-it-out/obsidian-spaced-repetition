# Notes review Obsidian plugin

- Notes should be atomic i.e. focus on a single concept
- SM2 Spaced Repetition Algorithm
    - Variant of Anki's
    - Initial note ease is calculated as a function of the average ease of incoming or outgoing links
    - fuzz: ceil(0.05 * interval)
    - Scheduling information stored as a HTML comment at the top of the note

## TODO

- Move scheduling information to YAML header
